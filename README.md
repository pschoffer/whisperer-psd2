# Whisperer

Whisperer is a merchant analytics tool based on PSD2.

### How it Works?
We partner with merchants to improve their ability to understand the customer base. Also, we are providing them real-time reports on purchase habits.

* Merchant creates an account on Whisperer
* Merchant tells about Whisperer to its customers and offers discounts/gifts if they sign up.
* Customer signs up to Whisperer and approves to share his/her financial data with Whisperer.
* Whisperer obtains an API token for that customer and stores it in database.
* Whisperer's crawlers consume data from PSD2 APIs and populate transactions into a database.
* We aggregate that data and provide business reports and metrics to merchants.

### Why Whisperer?
Today, only big merchants have the capability of building customer loyalty and analytics platforms. Whisperer provides this capability to small merchants as well.

Moreover, the existing loyalty and analytics platforms work with only that merchants or that banks customer base. Whisperer works with all banks and all merchants.

### Future Work
Whisperer has a potential that can grow in many directions.

* Pre-defined reports for merchants
* Dynamic reports for every merchant need
* Campaign recommendation engine
* Merchant integrations for very granular order details
